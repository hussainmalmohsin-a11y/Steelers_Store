# üèà SteelersStore (Java Swing)

A desktop **shopping & invoicing** demo built with Java and Swing. The app reads a product catalog from `items.txt`, lets customers select items and quantities via dialogs, calculates **tax** and **shipping**, and shows a formatted **invoice**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Loads items from a text file (`items.txt`), with code ‚Üí name ‚Üí price
- Guided purchase flow using Swing dialogs (`JOptionPane`)
- Calculates:
  - **Subtotal** (total before tax)
  - **Tax** at 7%
  - **Shipping**: $20 if subtotal < $100, otherwise free
- Pretty invoice using `JTextArea` (name, address, line items, totals)
- Basic validation and malformed line handling

## üß≠ How to Use

1. On launch, the app:
   - Loads `items.txt`
   - Prompts for **name** and **address**
2. For each purchase:
   - Enter an **item code**
   - Enter a **quantity**
   - Confirm whether you want to **add more items**
3. When finished:
   - Totals are computed
   - A formatted **invoice** is displayed

### Invoice Example

```
Name: Troy Polamalu
Address: 43 Blitz Ave, Pittsburgh, PA

Items Purchased:
1003    Terrible Towel     $19.99  Quantity: 3   Total: $59.97
1005    Cap                $24.00  Quantity: 2   Total: $48.00

Total before tax: $107.97
Tax: $7.56
Shipping: $0.00
Final Amount Due: $115.53
```

---

## üßÆ Totals Logic

- **Subtotal**: sum of `price √ó quantity` across selected items
- **Tax**: `subtotal √ó 0.07`
- **Shipping**: `$20` if `subtotal < $100`, else `$0`
- **Final Amount**: `subtotal + tax + shipping`

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

- **Malformed lines** in `items.txt` ‚Üí warning dialog, line skipped
- **Unknown item codes** entered during purchase are ignored silently (could be enhanced‚Äîsee roadmap)
- `NumberFormatException` while parsing shows an error dialog
